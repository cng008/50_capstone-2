# :dart: **Purpose and Features**

- Responsive clone of Spotify's Web Application.
- Collaborative playlists

The goal of this app is to make a simplified full-stack clone of Spotify‚Äôs desktop application UI using PERN stack technologies.

This application provides users a way to easily search Spotify's song database without any extra frills or ads.

## **User Flow & Features**

- Anyone can browse through the site, however, if a user wants to search and save songs to a playlist, they will need to be logged in.
<!-- - Users can log into the site using their Spotify account, which returns an access token to allow access to search songs using the Spotify API in the Search component 
- Logged in user's profile name and image shows in header and in playlists they create -->
- Allow (logged in) users to search tracks, artists, albums
- All users can view, add, edit, and delete playlists.
- Must log in if you want to access songs, Christien's Discover Playlist
- Use sessionStorage to keep the token and token expiry time in simple state. This way, when the page is loaded, it can first look for it there.
- Use sessionStorage to store Discover Weekly data (fixes Spotify API fetch issues with refreshing react app)
- View playlist details and all songs associated with it

<!-- - `/v1/me` -->

- `/v1/playlists/<playlist-id>`
- `/v1/artists/<artist-id> `
- `/v1/search `

#### Internal API Overview

- Songs, Artists, Albums, Playlists, and Users are stored in the site's backend database (PostgreSQL)

## :construction_worker: **How to Run**

### Go to [http://cng008-spotify-clone.surge.sh](http://cng008-spotify-clone.surge.sh)

##### OR

### Make PostgreSQL tables

    $ psql < spotify.sql

### Run Backend

    $ git clone https://github.com/cng008/spotify-web-player-clone.git
    $ cd backend
    $ npm i
    $ nodemon server.js
    $ cd ..

#### Unit Tests

    $ npm test

### Run Frontend

    $ cd frontend
    $ npm i --legacy-peer-deps
    $ npm start

#### Unit Tests

    $ npm test

## Challenges

There were many challenges figuring how to piece the frontend and backend together.

- Issue: keeping a user logged into their account so that they wouldn't be logged out of their spotify authentication on page refresh.
  - Resolution: Storing this data in the browser solved this issue.
- Issue: retrieving data from Spotify's API and figuring out how to save it to the backend while needing multiple requests for the data I needed
  - Resolution: saving data to useState when variables weren't accessible where needed or using state to get multiple api requests
- Issue: Users wanting to login using their irl Spotify account must be explicitly added under the section "Users and Access" by Christien before they can authenticate with the app (Spotify's rules)
  - Resolution: disable spotify authentication login method and replace with axios method to fetch token using basic authorization
- Issue: backend tests wouldn't pass when run together as `jest`
  - Solved: tests passing under `npm test`
- Issue: components that contain useContext hooks in the frontend are passing as undefined, therefore not passing unit tests
  - will revisit later
